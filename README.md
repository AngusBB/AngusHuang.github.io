## Summary
As a mathematics student with a strong passion for artificial intelligence, I enjoy leveraging my mathematical knowledge to solve real‚Äêworld computer vision tasks through AI integration. For example, I have recently developed a real‚Äêtime automatic system for tracking and analyzing basketball matches using computer vision, deep learning models, and various mathematical techniques. As hobbies, I have served as the team leader in three AI Cup competitions, each with commendable results.
